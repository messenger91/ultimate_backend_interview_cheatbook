Be prepared for:

SQL queries for complex JOINs and aggregations

Algorithmic problems (often on LeetCode Easy/Medium)

Designing a simple service (URL shortener, chat, blog API)

Code analysis for bugs or optimization

Questions about your experience from your resume

🎯 Preparation Recommendations
Focus on the company's stack (look at the job posting and their technology blog)

Explore 2-3 technologies you list as your core competencies

Prepare questions for the interviewer about projects, the team, and processes

Practice out loud – explain your solutions as if the interviewer is not an expert

Review your past projects – you will be asked for details

Good luck in your interview! Remember that honesty and the ability to think out loud are often more valuable than knowing all the right answers.
